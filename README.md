## CISCO PACKET TRACER:
The project employs CISCO PACKET TRACER, a freely available software that visually represents network connections and simulates data transfer, providing a realistic depiction of a functioning network. This tool proves instrumental in the planning and testing phases of the LAN setup.

## Network Setup:
The network comprises essential components, including PCs, a printer, a switch, and a router. The connection topology involves using an automatic connection for convenience. The network is built within an Internet Lab environment, consisting of four PCs, one printer, one switch, and one router. The components are interconnected using wired connections, with the router connected to the switch. Each device is assigned a dedicated IP address to facilitate seamless communication within the network.

In summary, this project strives to establish a robust and scalable LAN infrastructure within the college, leveraging Cisco's industry-leading networking solutions and the practicality of CISCO PACKET TRACER to enhance communication and collaboration across different departments.
